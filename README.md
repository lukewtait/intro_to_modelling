# An Introduction to Modelling Brain Dynamics

This is the Github repository for the workshop *"An Introduction to Modelling Brain Dynamics"* run online in 2020. The target audience for the workshop is researchers interested in brain dynamics with little or no mathematical background, e.g. neuroscientists, psychologists, or biologists. The workshop focuses on dynamical systems modelling of large scale brain activity such as those recorded by EEG, MEG, or fMRI. The workshop is split into four sessions, three of which have been completed and are available in this repository. Sessions are: 

1. An introduction to modelling the brain, Luke Tait
1. Dynamics on networks: Application to epilepsy, Marinho Lopes
1. Bifurcations in neural dynamics and cognition, Dominik Krzeminski and Luke Tait
1. Fitting models to neuroimaging data, Alex Shaw (to be run in the future, date TBC)

This repository contains all slides and practical files for the workshop to date. Video recordings of the seminars can be found at [Luke Tait's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0lXn8cYF0RKceP8B9lcZtg).
